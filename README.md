# Simple Blockchain in Go
A basic blockchain implementation in Go, designed for learning and experimentation. This project shows how to:

- Define a `Block` structure with timestamp, data, and hash
- Link blocks via their previous hash
- Build a `Blockchain` with a genesis block and append new blocks
- Calculate SHA-256 hashes for each block
- Print the blockchain to the console
